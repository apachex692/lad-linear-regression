Regression analysis is widely employed in various fields such as economics, finance, psychology, and natural sciences to model and analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions. It provides valuable insights into the strength and direction of the relationships between variables, allowing researchers and analysts to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions from data.
